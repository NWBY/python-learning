# Virtual environments are used to isolate Python from projects from one another
# This can be done by creating a virtual environment using venv which is the default for Python3
# Creating venvs: python3 -m venv /path/to/project
# Activate a venv with: source <venv>/bin/activate
# Once the venv is active we would want to install our packages with pip in there
